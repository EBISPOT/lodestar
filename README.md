# Lodestar

Lodestar is a Linked Data Browser and SPARQL endpoint. Lodestar is a Java based web app that can wrap any existing SPARQL endpoint to provide a set of additional SPARQL and Linked Data services. Lodestar was developed to provide a consistent set of SPARQL and Linked Data services across the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). Some of the service provided by Lodestar:

* Javascript based SPARQL endpoint with configurable example queries and paginated results table
* Read only SPARQL endpoint for protection from write operations
* A single SPARQL endpoint that provides a UI, the service and a SPARQL 1.1 service description
* SPARQL syntax highlighting provided by CodeMirror
* Works with any SPARQL endpoint (Includes Virtuoso JDBC connection option)
* Linked data browser for navigating data from a SPARQL endpoint
* Configurable resource description/linked data pages:
  * Renders resources by label where possible
  * Grouping of related resource by type
  * Set top facts to display, such as labels and descriptions
  * Configurable limits for how many related resources to render in the browser
* Renders depictions of resources
* Handles content negotiation for both SPARQL queries and linked data pages
* CORS enabled for cross domain scripting
* Basic REST API for accessing data in simplified JSON format

To see a demonstration of the Lodestar linked data browser please see the [Expression Atlas RDF website](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/services/atlas/sparql). Lodestar has been primarily developed as an internal tool for EBI services deploying RDF, however, the application should be sufficiently generic that others can use it. I can't guarantee any support for the software at this time, but please feel free to use it or adapt for your own purposes and let me know how you get on.
